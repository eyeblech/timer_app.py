# Python Timer App

Here's a Python GUI program that implements your timer requirements using the `tkinter` library for the GUI and the `pygame` library for playing the bell sound. Below is the solution.
Instructions to Run the Program

Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed. Install pygame for sound playback using:

```sh
pip install pygame
```
Save the code: Copy the code to a file, e.g., timer_app.py.

Run the program: Execute the file using Python:

```sh
python timer_app.py
```
# Functionality:

Click the default timer buttons (4 min, 8 min, etc.).
Enter a custom time in minutes and start it.
Stop the timer anytime using the "Stop Timer" button.


Sound: A "ting" sound will play when the timer finishes. The program generates this sound dynamically if the file is not found.
